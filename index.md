libhermitMPK is a new design bringing memory isolation inside a unikernel instance while keeping a *single address space*.
By leveraging Intel Memory Protection Keys (MPK), intra-unikernel isolation can be provided without impacting the lightweightness and performance benefits of unikernels.
libhermitMPK provides isolation between trusted and untrusted components: (1) safe from unsafe Rust kernel code and (2) kernel from user code.

libhermitMPK is implemented on top of [RustyHermit](https://github.com/hermitcore/libhermit-rs).

### Trying it out
libhermitMPK is open source and all the code and instructions are on GitHub:
- [https://github.com/ssrg-vt/libhermitMPK](https://github.com/ssrg-vt/libhermitMPK)

### Design Principles
libhermitMPK follows the design objectives: (1) preservation of a single address space, (2) isolation of various memory areas, and (3) negligible cost. Below are evaluation results to demonstrate the design principles.

`write_bytes` is an unsafe kernel function writing byte to an arbitrary address. The isolated `write_bytes`
introduces a 6% slowdown compared to the vainila `write_bytes` when writing 4KB at a time.

The results of memory/compute intensive benchmarks from various suites including NPB, PARSEC, and Phoenix illustrate
that the average slowdown imposed by the intra-unikernel isolation compared with the vanilla unikernel is only 0.6%
